# Poller Design Patterns

Practical patterns for writing reliable pollers. Read SKILL.md first for the basics.

## State Management

Pollers are stateless processes that run on a cron schedule. Between runs, they need to remember what they've already seen. This is entirely the poller's responsibility — the scheduler doesn't track state for you.

### The Cursor Pattern

Every poller needs a cursor — a marker for "where I left off." Store it in `STATE_DIR`.

```python
STATE_DIR = Path(os.environ.get("STATE_DIR", "."))
CURSOR_FILE = STATE_DIR / "cursor.json"

def load_cursor():
    if CURSOR_FILE.exists():
        return json.loads(CURSOR_FILE.read_text())
    return {}

def save_cursor(cursor):
    STATE_DIR.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
    CURSOR_FILE.write_text(json.dumps(cursor, indent=2))
```

**Use timestamps, not IDs.** URIs and IDs can be deleted, reordered, or non-monotonic. Timestamps (`indexed_at`, `created_at`, `updated_at`) are stable and monotonically increasing.

```python
# Good — timestamp cursor
cursor = load_cursor()
last_seen = cursor.get("last_indexed_at")
for item in items:
    if last_seen and item.indexed_at <= last_seen:
        continue
    # process item...
    cursor["last_indexed_at"] = item.indexed_at
save_cursor(cursor)

# Bad — URI cursor (fragile)
if item.uri == last_uri:
    break  # What if this URI was deleted?
```

### Always Save the Cursor

Save cursor state even when there are no new items. This prevents re-processing if the cursor file was missing.

```python
# Always save, even on empty runs
save_cursor(cursor)
```

### Cursor Recovery

On first run (no cursor file), either:
- **Process nothing** — safest default, avoids flooding the agent with old items
- **Process last N items** — if you want to bootstrap with recent history

```python
cursor = load_cursor()
if not cursor:
    # First run: only process items from the last hour
    cutoff = (datetime.now(timezone.utc) - timedelta(hours=1)).isoformat()
    cursor["last_indexed_at"] = cutoff
```

## Filtering

Pollers should be selective. The agent gets one event per stdout line, so noise = wasted LLM calls.

### Filter by Type

Most APIs return mixed notification types. Only emit the ones your agent can act on.

```python
# Good — selective
ACTIONABLE_TYPES = {"reply", "mention", "quote"}
for notif in notifications:
    if notif.reason not in ACTIONABLE_TYPES:
        continue

# Bad — everything including likes, follows, reposts
for notif in notifications:
    emit(format_notification(notif))  # Agent can't do anything with "New like from @user!"
```

### Don't Filter on Read/Seen Status

Many APIs have an `is_read` or `seen` flag. Don't use it — it changes when anyone (or any client) views the resource, which may not be your agent.

```python
# Bad — breaks if you view profile in a browser
if notif.is_read:
    continue

# Good — use your own cursor
if last_seen and notif.indexed_at <= last_seen:
    continue
```

## Prompt Quality

The `prompt` field is what the agent sees. Make it actionable.

### Include Context for Action

If the agent needs to reply, it needs URIs and CIDs. If it needs to close an issue, it needs the issue number.

```python
# Good — agent has everything it needs to act
prompt = f'@{handle} replied to your post: "{text}"'
prompt += f"\nReply URI: {notif.uri} | CID: {notif.cid}"
prompt += f"\nOriginal post URI: {notif.reason_subject}"

# Bad — agent knows something happened but can't do anything
prompt = f"@{handle} replied: {text}"
```

### Truncate Thoughtfully

Long text should be truncated, but include enough for the agent to understand context.

```python
text = (record.text[:300] + "...") if len(record.text) > 300 else record.text
```

## Error Handling

Pollers run unattended. Failures should be silent (exit non-zero) rather than emitting garbage.

```python
def main():
    try:
        client = create_client()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Auth failed: {e}", file=sys.stderr)
        sys.exit(1)

    try:
        response = client.fetch_notifications()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"API call failed: {e}", file=sys.stderr)
        sys.exit(1)

    # Only reach emit() if everything succeeded
    for item in process(response):
        emit(item)
```

**Never emit on error.** A malformed event wastes an LLM call. Exit non-zero instead — the scheduler logs it as `poller_nonzero_exit`.

## Local Event Log

Optionally write events to a local JSONL file for debugging and history. This is separate from stdout (which the scheduler reads).

```python
EVENTS_FILE = STATE_DIR / "events.jsonl"

def emit(prompt):
    event = {"poller": POLLER_NAME, "prompt": prompt}
    # Stdout — scheduler picks this up
    print(json.dumps(event), flush=True)
    # Local log — stays for debugging
    with open(EVENTS_FILE, "a") as f:
        event["timestamp"] = datetime.now(timezone.utc).isoformat()
        f.write(json.dumps(event) + "\n")
```

## File Layout

```
skills/my-monitor/
├── SKILL.md           ← skill metadata + docs
├── pollers.json       ← declares pollers (scheduler reads this)
├── poller.py          ← the script
├── cursor.json        ← cursor state (written by poller)
├── events.jsonl       ← optional local event log
└── requirements.txt   ← if the poller has Python dependencies
```

Keep all poller state in `STATE_DIR`. Don't write to random locations — it makes debugging hard and breaks if the skill is moved.

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| URI-based cursors | URIs can be deleted or reordered | Use timestamps |
| Filtering on `is_read` | Changes when any client views the resource | Use your own cursor |
| Emitting likes/follows | Agent can't act on these | Filter to actionable types |
| Missing URI/CID in prompts | Agent can't reply or take action | Include identifiers |
| No error handling | Malformed output wastes LLM calls | try/except + sys.exit(1) |
| Hardcoded paths | Breaks when moved or run by scheduler | Use STATE_DIR env var |
| Writing state outside STATE_DIR | Hard to debug, breaks portability | Keep everything in STATE_DIR |
| Forgetting `reload_pollers` | Poller exists but scheduler doesn't know about it | Always call after creating/updating pollers.json |
